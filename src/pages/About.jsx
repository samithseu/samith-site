          year. Even coding is hard for me, I'm still trying to learn and
          practise more since 2020 because the quarantine make me want to learn
          more about the computer. As a passionate frontend developer, I thrive
          on crafting intuitive and visually compelling user experiences. With a
          strong <span className="highlight"> foundation</span> in modern web
          technologies like <span className="highlight">HTML, CSS</span> and{" "}
          <span className="highlight">JavaScript</span>, I specialize in
          leveraging frameworks like <span className="highlight">Vue.JS </span>{" "}
          and <span className="highlight"> React.JS</span> to build responsive,
          user-friendly interfaces. My commitment to clean, maintainable code
          ensures that every project is not just visually appealing but also
          highly functional and optimized for{" "}
          <span className="highlight"> performance</span>. Whether collaborating
          with teams or working independently, I bring a{" "}
          <span className="highlight">detail-oriented </span>
          approach and a creative mindset to every project, aiming to bridge the
          gap between design and functionality. Iâ€™m dedicated to staying ahead
          of industry trends, constantly learning, and using my skills to turn
          <span className="highlight"> innovative</span> ideas into digital
          reality.
